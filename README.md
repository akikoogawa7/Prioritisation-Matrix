# Priority-Matrix
The priority matrix is an attempt to classify group tasks based on the Eisenhower Matrix, which helps a team decide on and priotise tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks.

```
CLASSES: [x: ('Urgent', 'Less Urgent'), y: ('Important', 'Less Important')]
```
