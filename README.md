# Priority-Matrix
The priority matrix is an attempt to classify group tasks based on the Eisenhower Matrix, which helps a team decide on and priotise tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks.

Our version of this basic prototype enables a generalisable template for all users to set a problem statement, positive/negative metrics and threshold for classifying for purposes of 'preferential signalling'.

```
CLASSES: [x: ('Urgent', 'Less Urgent'), y: ('Important', 'Less Important')]
```
